Shift work is a type of work scheduling in which workers succeed each other at the same workplace to perform the same operations. Most of the working hours during the shift system fall outside the standard workday, such as evening, night, or weekend shifts. An on-call shift is a special form of shift work where in case of an emergency, particular workers are called for their duties. This variety of shift work is the most appropriate to employ the services of locums.
Locums are workers hired on a temporary basis to fill vacancies in full-time positions. They have become a common career option, especially among the physician workforce, dating back to 1985 and continue to be an increasingly used employment option to cope with short-term vacancies. Locums are essential for maintaining continuity of service, filling service gaps in rotas due to absence or recruitment and retention problems, maintaining appropriate staffing levels, and allowing staffing flexibility. Our locum online and digital services connect validated professionals to clients requiring their expertise for temporary, short-term, and one-time jobs.
